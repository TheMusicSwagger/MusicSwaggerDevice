MusicSwaggerProtocol v1.0 definition :
    - based on UDP/IP
    - simplest possible (shortest)
    - Server's hostname : "musicswagger_server"
    - port : 55666

Data representation :
    | DEST CUID | OP NUM | DATA LEN | DATA | ( CRC |)
    | (8b)      | (8b)   | (8b)     | (8b) | ( (8b)|)

    - DESTination Connection Unique Identifier : the CUID of the destination of the packet (0x00 is the server, 0xff is no one particularly)
    - OPeration NUMber : number describing wich operation is given
    - DATA LENgth : the size of the data following in bytes
    - DATA : the actual data of the packet, formatted as the OP requires to
    (- CRC)

Operations list :
    - OP NUM = OP NAME :
        - Description...
        | DATA DESC    |
        | (SIZE in bit)|
        - PARAMETER :
            - OPTION : DESC

    - 0x00 = INFO :
        - Generally for server response, give some info about the situation
        | ID  |
        | (8b)|
        - ID :
            - 0x00 : Nothing to say
            - 0x01 : Packet error
            - 0x02 : Invalid CUID

    - 0x01 = ASK CUID :
        - When you start a device that needs a CUID to communicate over the network
        | GUID   |
        | (128b) |
        - GUID :
            The GUID of the device

    - 0x02 = GIVE CUID :
        - Server response to a 0x01 (sent to CUID 0xff)
        | CUID |
        | (8b) |
        - CUID :
            The new CUID of the device

    - 0x03 = ASK SPEC :
        - Ask for specification (generally from the server to the device)
        NO DATA

    - 0x04 = GIVE SPEC :
        - Give specification (generally for the server about the device)

    - 0x10 = ASK PRECISION :
        - To get the precision of the data the server wants to get
        NO DATA

    - 0x11 = GIVE PRECISION :
        - Server response to a 0x10
        | PREC |
        | (8b) |
        - PREC :
            The actual precision of the server (in number of bits, generally 0x0f)

    - 0x20 = ASK DATA :
        - When the server wants data
        NO DATA

    - 0x21 = GIVE DATA
        - When device need to give data to server
        | PREC |
        | (8b) |
