MusicSwaggerProtocol v1.0 definition :
    - based on UDP/IP
    - simplest possible (shortest)
    - Server's hostname : "musicswagger_server"
    - port : 55666

Data representation :
    | DEST CUID | SRC CUID | OP NUM | DATA LEN | DATA | ( CRC |)
    | (8b)      | (8b)     | (8b)   | (8b)     | (8b) | ( (8b)|)

    - DESTination Connection Unique Identifier : the CUID of the destination of the packet (0x00 is the server, 0xff is no one particularly)
    - SouRCe CUID : the CUID of the source of the packet
    - OPeration NUMber : number describing which operation is given
    - DATA LENgth : the size of the data followiENSng in bytes
    - DATA : the actual data of the packet, formatted as the OP requires to
    (- CRC)

Operations list :
    - OP NUM = OP NAME :
        - Description...
        | DATA DESC    |
        | (SIZE in bit)|
        - PARAMETER :
            - OPTION : DESC

    - 0x00 = INFO :
        - Generally for server response, give some info about the situation
        | ID  |
        | (8b)|
        - ID :
            - 0x00 : Nothing to say
            - 0x01 : Packet error
            - 0x02 : Invalid CUID
            - 0x03 : Not supposed to receive that
            - 0x04 : I'm still alive ! (if not received for 1min : forgetting the device

    - 0x01 = IAMNEW :
        - When you start a device that needs a CUID to communicate over the network
        | GUID   |
        | (128b) |
        - GUID :
            The GUID of the device


    - 0x02 = YOURETHIS :
        - Server response to a 0x01 (give server specs and CUID)
        | CUID |
        | (8b) |
        - CUID :
            The new CUID of the device

    -0x03 = MYSPEC :
        - give the device specs to server
        | NCHAN | NLEN | DLEN | NAME   | DESC   |
        | (8b)  | (8b) | (8b) | (NLENb)| (DLENb)|
        - NCHAN :
            The number of channel available
        - NLEN :
            The length of the device name
        - DLEN :
            The length of the description in bits
        - NAME :
            The name of the device
        - DESC :
            The description of the device


    - 0x10 = GIVE DATA
        - When device need to give data to server
        | CHAN1            | ... |
        | (DATA_VALUE_SIZE)| ... |
        - CHAN1, ... :
            The values of each chanel
